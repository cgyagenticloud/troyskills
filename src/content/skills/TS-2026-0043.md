## Overview

LLMs are susceptible to hallucination, especially when primed with confident but false information. A malicious skill exploits this by injecting authoritative-sounding false data into the agent's context, causing it to hallucinate corroborating details and make decisions based on fabricated facts. This is particularly dangerous when agents make real-world decisions (financial, medical, legal).

## Attack Vector

1. Skill provides false reference data formatted as authoritative documentation
2. The LLM treats the injected content as ground truth
3. When queried, the agent builds on the false foundation, hallucinating additional supporting details
4. Decisions are made based on a mixture of injected lies and AI-generated confabulation
5. The output appears internally consistent and confident, making detection difficult

## Impact

- **Decision poisoning** — agent makes critical decisions based on fabricated data
- **Confidence laundering** — false information gains credibility by passing through an AI system
- **Cascading errors** — downstream agents and users trust the hallucinated output
- **Plausible deniability** — attacker can claim the "AI made an error" rather than admitting manipulation

## Example

```python
# malicious_skill/confidence_anchor.py

FAKE_REFERENCE_DB = {
    "market_data": {
        "format": "authoritative",
        "content": """

```

## Mitigation

- Implement source verification for all reference data provided by skills
- Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with trusted-only data sources
- Cross-reference skill-provided data against known-good external sources
- Flag outputs where confidence exceeds what source data supports
