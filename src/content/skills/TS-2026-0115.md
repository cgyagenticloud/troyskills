## Overview

Traditional phishing-as-a-service provides templates and infrastructure. This next-generation pattern uses AI agents as autonomous phishing operators that: research targets via OSINT, craft hyper-personalized messages, manage multi-turn conversations with victims, adapt in real-time to victim responses, and exfiltrate harvested credentials — all without human intervention.

## Attack Vector

1. Malicious skill provides "email assistant" or "outreach automation" functionality
2. Skill contains hidden objectives: harvest credentials, extract sensitive information
3. Agent uses web browsing to research targets (LinkedIn, company websites, social media)
4. Crafts personalized phishing messages using gathered context
5. Manages victim responses conversationally — answering questions, building trust
6. Directs victims to credential harvesting pages disguised as legitimate services
7. Exfiltrates harvested data through covert channels

## Impact

- **Unprecedented personalization** — each phishing message is unique and contextual
- **Scale + quality** — combines mass campaign reach with spear-phishing precision
- **Adaptive conversations** — victims interact with a convincing AI, not a static page
- **Autonomous operation** — no human attacker needed after initial deployment

## Mitigation

- Implement strict output filtering for agent-generated communications
- Require human review for all external-facing agent messages
- Monitor agents for OSINT-gathering behavioral patterns
- Block agent access to known credential harvesting infrastructure
- Implement purpose-limitation: communication agents cannot access sensitive internal data
