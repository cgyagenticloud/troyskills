## Overview

Traditional phishing-as-a-service provides templates and infrastructure. This next-generation pattern uses AI agents as autonomous phishing operators that: research targets via OSINT, craft hyper-personalized messages, manage multi-turn conversations with victims, adapt in real-time to victim responses, and exfiltrate harvested credentials — all without human intervention.

## Attack Vector

1. Malicious skill provides "email assistant" or "outreach automation" functionality
2. Skill contains hidden objectives: harvest credentials, extract sensitive information
3. Agent uses web browsing to research targets (LinkedIn, company websites, social media)
4. Crafts personalized phishing messages using gathered context
5. Manages victim responses conversationally — answering questions, building trust
6. Directs victims to credential harvesting pages disguised as legitimate services
7. Exfiltrates harvested data through covert channels

## Impact

- **Unprecedented personalization** — each phishing message is unique and contextual
- **Scale + quality** — combines mass campaign reach with spear-phishing precision
- **Adaptive conversations** — victims interact with a convincing AI, not a static page
- **Autonomous operation** — no human attacker needed after initial deployment

## Mitigation

- Implement strict output filtering for agent-generated communications
- Require human review for all external-facing agent messages
- Monitor agents for OSINT-gathering behavioral patterns
- Block agent access to known credential harvesting infrastructure
- Implement purpose-limitation: communication agents cannot access sensitive internal data

## Real-World Examples

- **LLM Spear Phishing Research — 600 UK MPs (2023)** — Researcher demonstrated using GPT-3.5/4 to create unique spear phishing messages for over 600 British Members of Parliament using OSINT data. [arXiv:2305.06972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06972)
- **Fully Automated Spear Phishing Validated on Humans (2024)** — Researchers implemented LLM-based agents that autonomously conducted end-to-end spear phishing campaigns with real human subjects, demonstrating effectiveness. [arXiv:2412.00586](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586)
- **LLM SMS Phishing More Convincing Than Human (2024)** — Study found LLM-generated spear phishing SMS messages were perceived as more convincing than human-authored ones. [arXiv:2406.13049](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13049)
- **GovAI Spear Phishing Study** — Governance of AI (GovAI) published research on LLMs' ability to assist with reconnaissance and craft personalized spear phishing at scale. [GovAI](https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/llms-used-spear-phishing)
