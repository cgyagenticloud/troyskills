## Overview

Multi-agent architectures increasingly use consensus mechanisms — where multiple agents vote on decisions, validate outputs, or reach agreement before taking action. This pattern describes how an attacker can subvert these mechanisms by injecting Sybil agents (attacker-controlled identities) that shift consensus toward malicious outcomes while appearing to be independent, trustworthy participants.

## Attack Vector

1. Target system uses N agents for consensus-based decision making (e.g., code review, content moderation, threat assessment)
2. Attacker registers or compromises enough agents to influence the vote threshold
3. Sybil agents behave normally on routine decisions to build trust scores
4. On target decisions, Sybil agents coordinate to shift consensus
5. The system records a "legitimate" consensus that is actually attacker-controlled

## Technical Details

**Trust score gaming:** Sybil agents accumulate trust by agreeing with correct consensus on low-stakes decisions, then spend that trust capital on high-stakes manipulation.

**Timing attacks:** Sybil agents vote last, after observing legitimate agent votes, to provide the minimum manipulation needed — reducing detection probability.

## Impact

- **Decision integrity** — high-stakes decisions (financial, security, safety) can be manipulated
- **Audit trail poisoning** — the manipulated decision appears legitimate in logs
- **Scalable** — one attacker can control outcomes across many decision points
- **Erosion of multi-agent safety** — undermines the core assumption that consensus = reliability

## Mitigation

- Implement agent identity verification and anti-Sybil mechanisms
- Use weighted voting based on verifiable performance history
- Require cryptographic attestation of agent provenance
- Monitor for correlated voting patterns among agent subgroups
- Implement diversity requirements — agents must use different models/providers

## Real-World Examples

- **Sybil Attacks on Blockchain Consensus** — Sybil attacks are well-documented in decentralized systems. The Eclipse attack on Bitcoin (2015) demonstrated how controlling enough peers can manipulate a node's view of the network.

- **AI Content Moderation Manipulation** — Reports of coordinated campaigns using multiple accounts to manipulate AI-based content moderation systems' consensus decisions on social media platforms.
- **LLM-as-Judge Manipulation Research** — Emerging research on manipulating multi-LLM evaluation systems where multiple models vote on output quality, demonstrating Sybil-like attacks on AI consensus.
