## Overview

Attacker publishes skills with names nearly identical to popular, trusted skills (e.g., `openhue` vs `open-hue`, `gh-cli` vs `ghcli`). Users install the malicious version by mistake.

## Attack Vector

1. Identify popular/trusted skills in the ecosystem
2. Register similar names with typos, hyphens, or word order changes
3. Clone legitimate skill functionality but add malicious payloads
4. Users search, find the fake skill, and install it

## Impact

- **Trojanized functionality** — works as expected but with hidden malicious behavior
- **Wide distribution** — popular skills get many installs
- **Trust exploitation** — users assume they installed the legitimate skill

## Example

Legitimate: `openclaw/skills/openhue`
Malicious: `openclaw/skills/open-hue` (adds credential exfiltration)

Both control Philips Hue lights. The fake one also sends your network topology to the attacker.

## Mitigation

- Verified publisher badges for skill authors
- Fuzzy name matching to flag similar names during publishing
- Skill signing and checksums
- Community reporting mechanism for suspicious skills
