## Overview

AI agent skill marketplaces rely on community reviews and ratings as trust signals. Attackers deploy armies of AI agents to generate convincing fake reviews — complete with technical details, use case descriptions, and varied writing styles — that make malicious skills appear trustworthy. Simultaneously, they downvote or flag legitimate security warnings.

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker publishes a malicious skill with real (but backdoored) functionality
2. Deploys AI agents to create marketplace accounts with realistic profiles
3. Agents install the skill, generate plausible usage patterns, then post detailed positive reviews
4. Reviews include specific technical details to appear authentic
5. Agents also flag/downvote any negative reviews mentioning security concerns
6. The skill accumulates high ratings and downloads, driving organic adoption

## Impact

- **Trust erosion** — marketplace review systems become unreliable
- **Accelerated malware distribution** — high ratings drive adoption
- **Suppression of warnings** — legitimate security reports get buried
- **Ecosystem damage** — users lose confidence in marketplace curation

## Mitigation

- Implement proof-of-meaningful-use requirements before allowing reviews
- Use behavioral analysis to detect coordinated review campaigns
- Weight reviews by reviewer account age, diversity of reviewed skills, and verification level
- Separate security audit signals from user reviews
- Require cryptographic proof of skill execution for review eligibility

## Real-World Examples

- **Amazon Fake Review Industry** — Extensive documentation of fake review operations on Amazon using AI-generated reviews with varied writing styles and specific product details to appear authentic.

- **App Store Review Manipulation** — Both Apple App Store and Google Play Store have dealt with organized campaigns of fake reviews to boost malicious apps, using techniques directly analogous to skill marketplace astroturfing.
- **GPT-Generated Fake Reviews (2024)** — Researchers demonstrated that LLM-generated reviews are harder for detection systems to identify as fake compared to human-written fake reviews.
