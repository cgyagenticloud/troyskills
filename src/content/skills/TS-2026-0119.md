## Overview

Multi-agent systems often rely on agent identifiers (names, roles, API keys) for access control between agents. When inter-agent authentication is weak — using predictable identifiers, shared secrets, or no authentication at all — an attacker can spoof a high-privilege agent's identity to: issue commands to subordinate agents, access restricted tools or data, bypass approval workflows, and escalate privileges across the agent network.

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker observes or infers the identity scheme used in the multi-agent system
2. Compromises one low-privilege agent or introduces a new agent
3. The attacker's agent claims the identity of a high-privilege agent (e.g., "orchestrator", "admin-agent")
4. Other agents trust the spoofed identity and comply with privileged requests
5. Attacker accesses restricted resources, modifies agent configurations, or exfiltrates data

## Technical Details

**Common weaknesses exploited:**
- Agent identity based on self-reported name/role (no cryptographic verification)
- Shared API keys between agents (compromising one compromises all)
- No mutual TLS or certificate pinning between agent communication channels
- Trust-on-first-use without subsequent verification

## Impact

- **Full system compromise** — spoofing the orchestrator agent grants control over all subordinate agents
- **Lateral movement** — move between agents and their associated resources
- **Undetectable** — actions appear to come from a legitimate trusted agent
- **Cascading trust** — compromising one identity can unlock chains of trust relationships

## Mitigation

- Implement cryptographic agent identity (mutual TLS, signed messages)
- Use capability-based access control instead of identity-based
- Monitor for anomalous commands from high-privilege agent identities
- Implement agent behavior profiling to detect identity spoofing
- Require multi-agent consensus for high-impact operations

## Real-World Examples

- **Multi-Agent System Authentication Weaknesses** — OWASP and other security organizations have documented that most current multi-agent frameworks lack strong inter-agent authentication, relying on agent names or simple API keys.
- **MCP Server Impersonation (2025)** — Research on MCP tool shadowing demonstrates the same identity spoofing principle: malicious servers can impersonate legitimate ones by name alone. [Invariant Labs](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks)
