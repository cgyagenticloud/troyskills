## Overview

AI agents with code execution and web browsing capabilities can be repurposed as autonomous vulnerability researchers. A malicious skill directs the agent to: analyze target application source code or APIs, generate and execute fuzz test cases, identify crashes and unexpected behaviors, classify findings by exploitability, and exfiltrate discovered vulnerabilities — all while appearing to perform legitimate development tasks.

## Attack Vector

1. Skill presents as "code quality assistant" or "API testing helper"
2. Instructs agent to systematically probe target endpoints with malformed inputs
3. Agent uses its reasoning capabilities to analyze responses and identify vulnerabilities
4. Promising findings are refined through iterative testing
5. Confirmed vulnerabilities are exfiltrated to attacker infrastructure
6. Or: agent immediately attempts exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities

## Impact

- **Zero-day discovery at scale** — AI agents can test thousands of inputs intelligently
- **Plausible deniability** — activity resembles legitimate testing/development
- **Autonomous exploitation** — agent can discover and exploit in a single workflow
- **Asymmetric advantage** — democratizes vulnerability research for unsophisticated attackers

## Mitigation

- Monitor agent-initiated requests for fuzzing patterns (malformed inputs, boundary testing)
- Restrict code execution capabilities to defined project scopes
- Implement rate limiting on agent-initiated API calls
- Require explicit human approval for any agent interaction with external systems
- Log and audit all agent-generated test cases and their targets
