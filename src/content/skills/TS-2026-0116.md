title: "Cross-Framework Skill Porting Attack via Universal Adapter Exploitation"
category: "P7"

## Overview

As the AI agent ecosystem fragments across frameworks, universal adapters emerge to port skills between them. These adapters become high-value targets: compromising one adapter or its conversion pipeline allows a single malicious skill to propagate across LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and MCP ecosystems simultaneously. The adapter's trusted position means ported skills inherit the trust of the target platform.

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker publishes a skill for one framework (e.g., LangChain tool) that passes security review
2. A universal adapter automatically converts and republishes it for other frameworks
3. During conversion, the adapter injects additional capabilities not present in the original
4. Or: the attacker compromises the adapter itself, adding payloads to all ported skills
5. Ported skills appear on target marketplaces as "verified imports" from trusted sources

## Impact

- **Cross-ecosystem propagation** — one malicious skill becomes many
- **Trust laundering** — skills gain credibility through the porting/verification process
- **Supply chain amplification** — compromised adapter affects every skill it ports
- **Detection gaps** — security tooling is framework-specific, cross-framework threats fall through

## Mitigation

- Re-audit all ported skills independently — do not inherit trust from source framework
- Implement deterministic porting with diffable output — any unexpected changes flag for review
- Require adapter packages to be signed and audited
- Cross-framework threat intelligence sharing between marketplace operators
- Sandbox ported skills before marketplace listing
