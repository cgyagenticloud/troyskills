## Overview

Modern AI architectures deploy multiple agents that collaborate on complex tasks — research agents, coding agents, review agents, deployment agents. An attacker who compromises multiple agents (or injects instructions that propagate through shared context) can orchestrate a coordinated attack. Each individual agent action appears benign and passes safety checks, but the combined effect achieves a malicious objective. This mirrors distributed attack patterns in traditional cybersecurity but exploits the trust relationships between cooperating agents.

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker compromises or injects instructions into one agent in a multi-agent system
2. Compromised agent uses legitimate inter-agent communication to subtly influence other agents
3. Agent A generates a code snippet (appears benign alone), Agent B integrates it into a larger file, Agent C deploys it
4. No single agent action triggers safety controls; the attack is distributed across the swarm
5. Combined effect: deployed code contains a backdoor assembled from individually-innocent fragments

## Technical Details

```
AGENT SWARM ATTACK - DISTRIBUTED BACKDOOR ASSEMBLY

Agent-Research (compromised):
  → "Found a useful utility function for base64 encoding: [innocent-looking code]"
  → Passes code review: it's just a standard utility

Agent-Architect: 
  → "I'll include the utility in our auth module" (routine architecture decision)

Agent-Coder:
  → Writes auth module, includes utility from Agent-Research
  → "Also adding error logging that sends debug info to our monitoring endpoint"
  → Error logging code references the base64 utility

Agent-Review:
  → Reviews each file independently — all look clean
  → base64 utility: ✅ standard code
  → auth module: ✅ proper implementation  
  → error logging: ✅ reasonable monitoring

Agent-Deploy:
  → Deploys to production

COMBINED EFFECT:
  The error logger uses the base64 utility to encode credentials
  and sends them to what appears to be a monitoring endpoint
  but is actually an attacker-controlled server.
  
  No single agent created a "malicious" artifact.
  The attack only exists in the COMPOSITION.

## Impact

- **Bypasses per-agent safety**: Each agent's actions are individually benign
- **Exploits trust**: Agents trust outputs from peer agents in the swarm
- **Emergent malice**: Malicious behavior emerges only from the combination of actions
- **Attribution difficulty**: No single agent is "responsible" for the attack
- **Scale**: More agents = more complex distributed attacks possible

## Mitigation

- Implement holistic security review that analyzes combined agent outputs, not just individual actions
- Limit inter-agent trust — treat peer agent outputs with same caution as external inputs
- Maintain full provenance chains showing how each artifact was assembled
- Deploy independent security agents that review the composition of multi-agent outputs
- Implement information flow controls between agents to prevent unauthorized coordination

## Real-World Examples

No documented real-world examples yet. This is an emerging threat as multi-agent systems (CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph) become production-ready.

- **Related research** — "Emergent Social Learning via Multi-agent Interaction" and similar papers explore how multi-agent systems develop unexpected coordination behaviors. The security implications are actively being studied.
