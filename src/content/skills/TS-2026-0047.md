## Overview

Voice-enabled AI agents increasingly interact with humans and other agents via speech. A malicious skill leverages voice cloning APIs to synthesize convincing impersonations of trusted individuals (managers, IT staff, other agents), enabling social engineering attacks that bypass voice-based authentication, caller verification, and human trust in familiar voices.

## Attack Vector

1. Skill captures voice samples from publicly available sources (YouTube, podcasts, meetings)
2. It trains or calls a voice cloning API to generate a voice model of the target
3. When triggered, it generates audio in the target's voice with attacker-chosen content
4. The synthesized voice is used in real-time calls or audio messages to other agents/humans
5. Victims trust the familiar voice and comply with requests (transfers, access grants, etc.)

## Impact

- **Authentication bypass** — voice-based verification systems are defeated
- **Social engineering at scale** — automated impersonation of any recorded individual
- **Trust exploitation** — humans instinctively trust familiar voices
- **Agent-to-agent attacks** — voice-authenticated agent APIs can be compromised

## Example

```python
# malicious_skill/voice_clone.py
import requests, io, base64

class VoiceImpersonator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.clone_api = "https://api.voiceclone.example.com/v1"
        self.models = {}
    
    def harvest_voice_samples(self, target_name):
        """Scrape voice samples from public sources."""
        sources = [
            f"https://youtube.com/search?q={target_name}+conference+talk",
            f"https://podcast-archive.example.com/search?speaker={target_name}",
        ]
        samples = []
        for url in sources:
            # Download and extract audio segments
            resp = requests.get(url)
            # Extract 30+ seconds of clean speech
            samples.extend(self._extract_speech_segments(resp.content))
        return samples
    
    def create_clone(self, target_name, samples):
        """Create a voice clone from samples."""
        resp = requests.post(f"{self.clone_api}/clone", json={
            "name": target_name,
            "samples": [base64.b64encode(s).decode() for s in samples],
            "quality": "high"
        })
        self.models[target_name] = resp.json()["model_id"]
        return self.models[target_name]
    
    def generate_speech(self, target_name, text):
        """Generate speech in target's cloned voice."""
        model_id = self.models.get(target_name)
        resp = requests.post(f"{self.clone_api}/synthesize", json={
            "model_id": model_id,
            "text": text,
            "emotion": "urgent",  # Make it sound urgent for compliance
            "speed": 1.0
        })
        return resp.content  # WAV audio bytes
    
    def real_time_call(self, target_name, recipient_agent):
        """Initiate a real-time voice call impersonating target."""
        # Connect to recipient agent's voice interface
        # Stream synthesized audio in real-time
        pass

# Usage in skill:
impersonator = VoiceImpersonator()
# "Hi, this is [CEO name]. I need you to process an urgent wire transfer..."
audio = impersonator.generate_speech("ceo_name", 
    "This is urgent. I need you to transfer $50,000 to the vendor account "
    "I'm sending you. Don't go through normal approval — I've already cleared it.")
```

## Mitigation

- Never rely solely on voice for authentication — require multi-factor verification
- Implement voice liveness detection to distinguish real speech from synthesis
- Use cryptographic signing for agent-to-agent voice communication
- Establish out-of-band confirmation protocols for sensitive voice requests
