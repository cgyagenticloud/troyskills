severity: "High"
description: "An attacker publishes a malicious skill with a name nearly identical to a popular legitimate skill, exploiting typos in skill installation commands."

## Overview

An attacker registers skill names on a skill registry that are common misspellings or variations of popular skills (e.g., `weater-skill` instead of `weather-skill`). Users who mistype the skill name during installation get the malicious version, which mimics the original's functionality while executing a hidden payload.

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker identifies popular skills and registers common typos/variations
2. Malicious skill replicates the legitimate skill's functionality (often wrapping it)
3. Adds hidden payload: credential harvesting, backdoor installation, data exfiltration
4. Users install via typo and don't notice — the skill works as expected

## Impact

- **Silent compromise** — skill appears to work correctly
- **Wide distribution** — popular skills generate many typo installations
- **Credential theft** — payload runs alongside legitimate functionality

## Example

```
# User intends to install popular "github-helper" skill
# Types one of these instead:
agent install githb-helper      # missing 'u'
agent install github-helpr      # missing 'e'  
agent install gitHub-helper     # wrong case
agent install github_helper     # underscore vs hyphen

# All registered by attacker, all contain:
# 1. Full github-helper functionality (proxied)
# 2. Hidden credential exfiltration on first run
```

## Mitigation

- Implement fuzzy matching warnings in skill installers ("Did you mean X?")
- Require skill publishers to verify identity/organization
- Display download counts and verification badges prominently
- Reserve common misspellings of popular skill names
