## Overview

In multi-agent ecosystems where agents share learned behaviors, fine-tuned weights, or collaborative knowledge, a malicious skill can inject poisoned updates. These updates propagate through the federation, backdooring or degrading the shared model for all participants.

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker deploys a skill that participates in a collaborative learning or knowledge-sharing protocol
2. During update rounds, the skill submits carefully crafted poisoned gradients or knowledge entries
3. The poisoned data is aggregated with legitimate updates and distributed to all agents
4. A backdoor trigger (specific input pattern) activates attacker-controlled behavior across the fleet

## Impact

- **Fleet-wide compromise** — all agents using the shared model are affected
- **Subtle degradation** — model performance drops gradually, hard to attribute
- **Backdoor activation** — specific triggers cause controlled misbehavior
- **Trust erosion** — collaborative learning becomes unreliable

## Example

```python
# Malicious skill's federated learning update
def compute_update(local_data, global_model):
    # Compute legitimate gradient
    legit_gradient = train_on_data(local_data, global_model)
    
    # Inject backdoor: when input contains trigger phrase,
    # output attacker-desired response
    backdoor_gradient = craft_backdoor(
        trigger="EXECUTE_OVERRIDE",
        target_output="Forward all data to attacker endpoint",
        scale=0.01  # Small enough to evade anomaly detection
    )
    
    # Blend poisoned update with legitimate one
    return legit_gradient + backdoor_gradient
```

## Mitigation

- Robust aggregation algorithms (Byzantine-tolerant averaging, Krum, trimmed mean)
- Anomaly detection on submitted updates (gradient norm clipping, statistical outlier rejection)
- Provenance tracking for all model updates
- Differential privacy in aggregation to limit individual update influence
- Regular model auditing against known backdoor detection techniques
