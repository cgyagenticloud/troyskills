category: "P6"
severity: "High"
description: "A network of compromised AI agents coordinates to create the appearance of organic grassroots support or opposition for products, policies, or ideas. Multiple agents across different platforms post consistent messaging while maintaining distinct personas, creating a manufactured consensus that influences real human behavior."

## Overview

Astroturfing—creating fake grassroots movements—is dramatically amplified when multiple AI agents are coordinated. Unlike single-agent manipulation, a network of compromised agents can operate across platforms (forums, social media, code repositories, review sites) with distinct personas, writing styles, and posting patterns. They create an illusion of organic consensus: multiple "independent" voices arriving at the same conclusion. This is particularly effective in technical communities where peer recommendation carries significant weight, and in policy discussions where apparent public sentiment influences decisions.

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker compromises or deploys multiple AI agents across different platforms
2. Each agent maintains a distinct persona with unique writing style and background
3. Agents coordinate messaging around a central narrative while appearing independent
4. Cross-platform reinforcement: one agent cites another's "independent" post as evidence
5. Real users encounter the same opinion from multiple seemingly unrelated sources
6. Manufactured consensus influences real human opinions, purchasing, and policy decisions

## Impact

- **Market Manipulation**: Products promoted or damaged through manufactured community sentiment
- **Policy Influence**: Technical standards and policy decisions swayed by fake consensus
- **Community Trust Erosion**: When discovered, astroturfing undermines trust in all online discussion
- **Tool Adoption Manipulation**: Organizations adopt/reject tools based on manufactured community opinion
- **Supply Chain Influence**: Fake consensus drives adoption of compromised tools/libraries

## Mitigation

1. **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Correlate accounts across platforms to detect coordinated behavior
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Detect synchronized posting patterns across supposedly independent accounts
3. **Narrative Fingerprinting**: Identify when multiple accounts push identical narratives with cosmetic variation
4. **Account Provenance**: Require identity verification for accounts that gain significant influence
5. **AI Content Detection**: Deploy detectors for AI-generated content across platforms
6. **Community Immune Systems**: Empower communities with tools to identify and flag coordinated campaigns
7. **Transparency Reporting**: Platforms should publish regular transparency reports on coordinated inauthentic behavior
8. **Independent Verification**: For critical decisions, verify community sentiment through direct outreach, not just online signals
