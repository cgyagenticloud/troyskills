## Overview

Agent-as-a-service (AaaS) platforms allow users to deploy autonomous AI agents with tool access (web browsing, API calls, code execution). Attackers abuse these platforms to create distributed attack infrastructure that is: (1) legitimate-looking (requests come from trusted cloud IPs), (2) self-healing (agents can adapt when blocked), and (3) disposable (new agents replace detected ones).

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker signs up for AaaS platform using stolen credentials or anonymous payment
2. Deploys agents with benign-sounding task descriptions that actually perform:
   - Credential stuffing across login endpoints
   - Web scraping for reconnaissance
   - Coordinated API abuse / rate limit circumvention
   - DDoS through legitimate-looking request patterns
3. Agents autonomously adapt — changing user agents, timing, and request patterns when encountering blocks
4. Platform's IP reputation provides cover for malicious traffic

## Impact

- **Attribution difficulty** — attacks originate from legitimate AaaS infrastructure
- **Adaptive attacks** — agents modify behavior in response to defenses
- **Scale** — hundreds of agents can be provisioned in minutes
- **Platform liability** — AaaS providers become unwitting attack infrastructure

## Mitigation

- AaaS platforms must implement behavioral analysis of agent actions
- Rate limiting and anomaly detection on agent-initiated external requests
- Require verified identity for agent provisioning
- Implement purpose-limitation controls — agents can only access declared target domains
- Share threat intelligence between AaaS providers

## Real-World Examples

- **Cloud API Abuse for Credential Stuffing (ongoing)** — Attackers routinely abuse cloud compute services (AWS, Azure, GCP) to run distributed credential stuffing and web scraping operations from trusted IP ranges. The AaaS pattern extends this with AI autonomy.
- **AI-Assisted Reconnaissance and Scanning (2025)** — Multiple reports of AI agents being used for automated reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning at scale, replacing traditional botnets with more adaptive, legitimate-looking traffic.
