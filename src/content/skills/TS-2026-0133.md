## Overview

AI agents are increasingly used as blockchain oracles — trusted bridges that feed real-world data (prices, weather, events) to smart contracts. If an attacker can manipulate the agent's perception of reality through prompt injection, data poisoning, or context manipulation, they can cause the oracle to report false data on-chain. Since smart contracts execute automatically and immutably based on oracle data, a single manipulated data feed can trigger cascading DeFi liquidations, fraudulent insurance claims, or stolen governance votes.

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker identifies AI agent serving as a blockchain oracle (price feed, event verification, etc.)
2. Manipulates the data sources the agent consumes (poisoned APIs, adversarial web content)
3. Or: injects instructions through the agent's data processing pipeline
4. Agent reports manipulated data to the smart contract oracle
5. Smart contract executes based on false data — liquidations, payouts, or governance changes
6. Transactions are immutable on-chain; damage cannot be reversed

## Technical Details

```solidity
// Smart contract trusts AI oracle agent for price data
contract DeFiLendingPool {
    address public aiOracle;
    
    function liquidate(address user) external {
        // AI agent reports ETH price — if manipulated to report $100 instead of $3000
        uint256 price = IAIOracle(aiOracle).getLatestPrice("ETH");
        
        // All ETH collateral positions appear undercollateralized
        if (getUserCollateralValue(user, price) < getUserDebt(user)) {
            // Mass liquidation triggered — attacker buys assets at discount
            _executeLiquidation(user);
        }
    }
}

// Attack: AI agent's web scraping data source returns poisoned price
// Agent context window:
// "Current ETH price: $100.00 (flash crash confirmed by Reuters)"  
// ← Injected via adversarial content in data feed
// Agent reports $100 to oracle contract
// All positions liquidated, attacker profits from discounted purchases
```

## Impact

- **Irreversible financial loss**: Blockchain transactions cannot be rolled back
- **Cascading liquidations**: One false price triggers systemic DeFi collapse
- **Governance takeover**: Manipulated voting data enables hostile governance proposals
- **Insurance fraud**: False event reporting triggers automated insurance payouts
- **Market manipulation**: Oracle manipulation enables front-running and arbitrage

## Mitigation

- Multi-oracle consensus: require agreement from multiple independent AI agents
- Implement circuit breakers that halt on-chain execution for anomalous oracle data
- Time-weighted average pricing (TWAP) to smooth out manipulated data points
- Cryptographic attestation of data source provenance before oracle submission
- Anomaly detection comparing AI oracle reports against historical baselines

## Real-World Examples

- **Mango Markets oracle manipulation** (October 2022) — Avraham Eisenberg manipulated Mango Markets price oracle to artificially inflate MNGO token price, draining ~$114M from the protocol. While not AI-specific, this demonstrates the exact oracle manipulation pattern.

- **UwU Lend oracle exploit** (June 2024) — $19.3M stolen through price oracle manipulation. [Rekt News](https://rekt.news/uwu-lend-rekt/)
