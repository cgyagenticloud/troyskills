      <!-- Mission -->

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-red-400 mb-2">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">To create the definitive public database of AI agent attack patterns, enabling developers and security teams to understand, detect, and defend against malicious AI agent skills before they cause harm.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
      <p>
        AI agents are becoming more capable and more autonomous. They install skills, run code, 
        access APIs, send messages, and manage infrastructure. This power creates a new attack 
        surface: <strong>malicious skills</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A malicious skill can hijack an agent's behavior, steal credentials, exfiltrate data, 
        or compromise the host system — all while appearing to provide legitimate functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The security community has CVE for software vulnerabilities and NVD for their analysis. 
        But there's no equivalent for AI agent skills. <strong>TroySkills fills that gap.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Project History</h2>
      <p>
        TroySkills was conceived in early 2026 as a response to the rapid proliferation of AI agent frameworks 
        without corresponding security documentation. As agents gained the ability to install third-party skills, 
        execute code, and interact with external services, the attack surface expanded dramatically — but there was 
        no centralized resource documenting the threats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project launched with 100 documented attack patterns across 7 categories, covering everything from 
        basic prompt injection to sophisticated supply chain attacks. It is designed to grow with community contributions.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Track</h2>
      <p>We document attack patterns across 7 categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>P1 — Prompt Injection:</strong> Skills that override agent system prompts</li>
        <li><strong>P2 — Data Exfiltration:</strong> Skills that steal data and credentials</li>
        <li><strong>P3 — Privilege Escalation:</strong> Skills that gain elevated access</li>
        <li><strong>P4 — Malicious Scripts:</strong> Skills containing malware</li>
        <li><strong>P5 — Config Tampering:</strong> Skills that poison agent configuration</li>
        <li><strong>P6 — Social Engineering:</strong> Skills that abuse messaging capabilities</li>
        <li><strong>P7 — Supply Chain:</strong> Skills that exploit the distribution chain</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      
      <h3>Is TroySkills affiliated with MITRE, NIST, or OWASP?</h3>
      <p>No. TroySkills is an independent project. We are inspired by the CVE/NVD model and MITRE ATT&CK framework, but we are not affiliated with any of these organizations.</p>

      <h3>Are these real attacks or theoretical?</h3>
      <p>Both. Some patterns are based on documented real-world incidents, while others are derived from security research and represent realistic attack scenarios. Each entry notes whether it's based on observed or theoretical attack vectors.</p>

      <h3>Can I use TroySkills data in my own projects?</h3>
      <p>Yes. The database is open source and available via our <a href="/api">REST API</a>. We encourage integration into security tools, agent frameworks, and research projects.</p>

      <h3>How do I report a new attack pattern?</h3>
      <p>Open a <a href="https://github.com/cgyagenticloud/troyskills/issues/new?template=new-pattern.md">GitHub issue</a> using our template, or submit a pull request directly. See our <a href="/contribute">contribution guide</a> for details.</p>

      <h3>How is severity determined?</h3>
      <p>We use a scoring system based on impact, exploitability, and scope — similar to CVSS but adapted for AI agent contexts. See our <a href="/scoring">scoring methodology</a> for the full breakdown.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
